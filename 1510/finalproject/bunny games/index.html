    <h1>Bunny Games</h1>
  
<p>Bunnies require mental and physical stimulation in order to be happy. The following are games you can play:</p>
<p>The Nibble and Sprint: Take a small bunch of tasty, scented greens – such as parsley – and sit near your bunnies. Let them come over to investigate and reward them with a little nibble. Then move to another spot and call your rabbits’ names and, when they follow, offer them another tasty titbit. </p>
<p>Magic Cups: Take two to three plastic cups (transparent for beginners), your bun’s favourite food, and sit down with your pets. Extra tasty herbs can work well for this game. Place a little food inside the cups and put them upside down on the ground. Now encourage your bunnies to come over to investigate and to get the treat out </p>
<p>The Hopping Challenge: Build a low wall out of cardboard boxes, such as the ones fizzy drink cans come in, and encourage your buns to hop over them by repeating the word “hop” and holding a tasty treat in front of them. When they make the leap, reward them with the treat, along with lots of praise.</p>

<p>THE NIBBLE AND SPRINT
Take a small bunch of tasty, scented greens – such as parsley – and sit near your bunnies. Let them come over to investigate and reward them with a little nibble. Then move to another spot and call your rabbits’ names and, when they follow, offer them another tasty titbit. Then pick up the pace and race to another spot and see if they follow (they probably will!). The game can last between five to 10 rounds or until your buns have had enough.

 

MAGIC CUPS
Take two to three plastic cups (transparent for beginners), your bun’s favourite food, and sit down with your pets. Extra tasty herbs can work well for this game. Place a little food inside the cups and put them upside down on the ground. Now encourage your bunnies to come over to investigate and to get the treat out – you may have to help them figure it out until they’ve got the hang of it. Give them lots of praise when they accomplish it. Add more food and repeat. Make sure you never leave your pet unattended with the plastic cups and don’t let them chew them.

 

THE HOPPING CHALLENGE
Build a low wall out of cardboard boxes, such as the ones fizzy drink cans come in, and encourage your buns to hop over them by repeating the word “hop” and holding a tasty treat in front of them. When they make the leap, reward them with the treat, along with lots of praise.

 

BUNNY BOWLING
Rabbits enjoy games that cater to their natural tendencies. A game of bunny bowling will appeal to their mischievous side, as they take great delight in knocking things over. Set up some toy bowling pins and watch as your buns nose-bonk them all down.

 

CHUCK IT
Some bunnies absolutely love picking up toys with their teeth and tossing them with a flick of their head. Toys for birds are great for this activity because buns can easily grip them. You can also provide cardboard tubes from paper towel or loo paper rolls stuffed with hay.

 

ROLL THE BALL
Get a small cat ball, preferably one with bells in it, that your rabbits can pick up with their teeth, and roll it towards your pets. After your bunnies have examined the ball, repeat the roll. After a while, you pets may start to bat the ball around with their noses or pick it up with their teeth. If they enjoy this, you may even get to the point where your buns return the ball to you.

 

MIND GAMES
Interactive rabbit toys provide your fluffy friends with rewarding mental challenges. Here are some to try out:

The Living World Teach N Treat Toy. Simply hide some of your buns’ favourite treats in the toy and let them use their sight, smell and smarts to track them down. There are three different difficulty levels so you can offer your pet more of a challenge as his skills improve. It’s a great learning experience that you and your furry friends can enjoy together.
For rabbits who love playing with balls, how about the Ancol Small Animal Treat and Activity Ball ? This fun little ball provides a rewarding brain game for inquisitive bunnies. All you have to do is put your rabbits’ favourite food inside the hollow ball, then adjust the size of the opening to create a suitable level of difficulty.
For super smart bunnies who are up for a challenge, the Trixie Snack Cube could fit the bill. This toy consists of one whole with three separate cubes that you can hide treats for in. A sisal rope is attached to the cubes, so your pets can pull the cubes out of the holder. The small holes in the cubes allow your bunnies to smell the treat and therefore trigger them to search for it.
