    <h1>Bunny Games</h1>
  
<p>Bunnies require mental and physical stimulation in order to be happy. The following are games you can play:</p>
<p>The Nibble and Sprint: Take a small bunch of tasty, scented greens – such as parsley – and sit near your bunnies. Let them come over to investigate and reward them with a little nibble. Then move to another spot and call your rabbits’ names and, when they follow, offer them another tasty titbit. </p>
<p>Magic Cups: Take two to three plastic cups (transparent for beginners), your bun’s favourite food, and sit down with your pets. Extra tasty herbs can work well for this game. Place a little food inside the cups and put them upside down on the ground. Now encourage your bunnies to come over to investigate and to get the treat out </p>
<p>The Hopping Challenge: Build a low wall out of cardboard boxes, such as the ones fizzy drink cans come in, and encourage your buns to hop over them by repeating the word “hop” and holding a tasty treat in front of them. When they make the leap, reward them with the treat, along with lots of praise.</p>
